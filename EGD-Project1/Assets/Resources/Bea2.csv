BC,Bea,Hey Peter, whats going on?
P1,Peter,I saw that movie last night! I didn't think it was really all that though.
P2,Peter,I'm pretty sure Chris Hempsworth is my Man Crush Monday... everyday now.
B1,Bea,That's because it wasn't all that. I don't know why everyone is talking about it because it really sucked.
B2E,Bea,You just like Chris Hempsworth because he was in the new movie, hop off the bandwagon.
P,Peter,Really? I'm so happy to know that SOMEONE has a different idea than everyone else. 
B,Bea,Yeah well somebody has to think for themselves or we would just all be robots.
PE,Peter,Yeah... Robots...
