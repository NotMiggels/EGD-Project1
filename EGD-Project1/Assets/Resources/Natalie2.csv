NC,Natalie,Pete!! Can you believe Carmine doesnt like the movie from last night? I thought about it and it's actually really good.
P1,Peter,Yeah... the alien definitely didnt deserve to die... And Chris Hempsworth is basically a god...
P2,Peter,Well it really wasnt all that so I can see what he's saying. 
N1E,Natalie,I knew you would understand! This is why I like you :)
N2C,Natalie,What do you mean? Last night you said you liked it?
P21,Peter,Oh I completely forgot about the alien scene, that really made the movie.
P22,Peter,No.. we said that it was a pretty basic movie, I still think its basic.
N21E,Natalie,I knew you would understand! This is why I like you :)
N22E,Natalie,Whatever Peter, I thought you were cool.
